            look forward to working with driven and successful teams. I thrive at both team and individual work,
            I can work with minimal supervision and under tight schedules and deliver expected results. I can easily blend into teams with people from anywhere in the world. Easily communicate with non-technical people and turn their ideas into software products.
          <div className="my-4"></div>

For the past 2 years, I have developed both technical and non-technical skills while working on both front-end and back-end projects using JavaScript, NodeJs, React, Tailwind, sass, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, and many more frameworks to solve and build real-world projects.
 
            At the same time, I have improved my professional communication,  listening, and conflict-resolution skills, making it fun to work with other programmers and teams from around the world.</p>
