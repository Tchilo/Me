          Software engineers have the superpower of creating almost anything! Think it and boom! there it is existing in the real world.  Software Engineering blows my mind and keeps me on my toes, not only that but it also keeps feeding my desire to constantly learn new things and improve my being.  I look forward to working with driven and successful teams. I am both a  team/solo player who can work with minimal supervision and can work under tight schedules and deliver expected results. I can easily blend into teams with people from anywhere in the world. Easily communicate with non-technical people and turn their ideas into software products.
          <div className="my-4"></div>

For the past 2 years, I have developed both technical and non-technical skills while working on both front-end and back-end projects using JavaScript, NodeJs, React, Tailwind, sass, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and many more frameworks to solve and build real-world projects.
 
At the same time, I have improved my professional communication,  listening, and conflict-resolution skills, making it fun to work with other programmers and teams from around the world.</p>
